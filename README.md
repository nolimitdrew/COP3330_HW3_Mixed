# COP3330_HW3_Mixed
Your task will be to create a class called Mixed, in the files "mixed.h" and "mixed.cpp", which will involve a variety of operator overloads. A Mixed object will store a quantity of fractions, in terms of whole value, numerators, and denominators. You will overload some basic operators for use with these objects, including arithmetic, comparison, and insertion/extraction (I/O) operators. Note: These operations must work even for large fractions (i.e. fairly large numbers of fractions) and should not overflow the capacity of the storage variables (ints) unless the actual number of fractions is very close to the upper limit of int storage.
